# drugs_in_wastewater
This repository consists of a single R-script which supports the paper "Mapping consumption and market size  of cocaine, amphetamine and MDMA through wastewater analysis - a Dutch case  study" by Thomas ter Laak et al. (submitted in 2024 - once it is published a full reference info will be given).
The script is self-contained (all data and functions to conduct the analysis are included).
At the start of the script some background-info is given and analysis steps are explained.
